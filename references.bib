  abstract = {This article proposes methods of predicting and preventing thermal failure within high-power ferrite structures of electric vehicle (EV) wireless charging inductive power transfer (IPT) by improving their ferrite layouts. A high-power IPT magnetic design suitable for wirelessly charging an EV at 50 kW using a heuristic approach is presented, where the chosen design achieves reduced heating within the magnetic structure. Recommendations are made that both avoid ferrite fracturing due to magnetic hotspots and cause temperature differentials across ferrite tiles, and regarding airgap distribution between ferrite tiles to reduce loss-inducing circulating flux within the ferrite structure without reducing coupling. Power transfer was simulated in ANSYS and PLECS under misaligned conditions, and validated experimentally with 93.7\% system efficiency. Thermal tests performed under rated volt-amps found the magnetics temperatures (after 30 min) could be reduced from 168 to 67 °C using an improved magnetic layout that reduced the thermal gradients within the ferrite tiles by 70\%. Leakage fluxes were targeted and validated to be below 15 µT, 950 mm from the center of the vehicle under rated power and worst-case misaligned conditions.},

  abstract = {Inductive power transfer (IPT) has progressed to be a power distribution system offering significant benefits in modern automation systems and particularly so in stringent environments. Here, the same technology may be used in very dirty environments and in a clean room manufacture. This paper reviews the development of simple factory automation (FA) IPT systems for both today’s complex applications and onward to a much more challenging application—IPT roadway. The underpinning of all IPT technology is two strongly coupled coils operating at resonance to transfer power efficiently. Over time the air-gap, efficiency, coupling factor, and power transfer capability have significantly improved. New magnetic concepts are introduced to allow misalignment, enabling IPT systems to migrate from overhead monorails to the floor. However, the demands of IPT roadway bring about significant challenges. Here, compared with the best FA practice, air-gaps need to be 100 times larger, power levels greater than ten times, system losses ten times lower to meet efficiency requirements, and systems from different manufacturers must be interoperable over the full range of operation. This paper describes how roadway challenges are being met and outlines the problems that still exist and the solutions designers are finding to them.},

  abstract = {As an essential part in a power converter, the magnetic cores and their design play an important role in achieving high efficiency and high power density. Accurate measurement of the core loss is important to their optimization. To improve the measurement accuracy (especially at high frequencies), previous methods proposed to cancel the reactive voltage of the testing core by using a cancellation capacitor or inductor. However, the value of the cancellation component is critical, and a small variation can induce a big measurement error, so extra effort is required to fine-tune the cancellation component value, which is a very time-consuming process and makes the standardization of the measurement instrument almost impossible. This paper presents a new measurement method with a partial cancellation concept that enables accurate core loss measurement for arbitrary wave excitation without the requirement to fine-tune the cancellation component value. The proposed method is experimentally verified up to 10 MHz.},

  abstract = {Inductors realized with high permeable MnZn ferrite require, unlike iron-powder cores with an inherent dis-tributed gap, a discrete air gap in the magnetic circuit to prevent saturation of the core material and/or tune the inductance value. This large discrete gap can be divided into several partial gaps in order to reduce the air gap stray field and consequently the proximity losses in the winding. The multi-gap core, realized by stacking several thin ferrite plates and inserting a non-magnetic spacer material between the plates, however, exhibits a substan-tial increase in core losses which cannot be explained from the intrinsic properties of the ferrite. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of the scientific literature regarding machining induced core losses in ferrite, dating back to the early 1970s, is provided which suggests that the observed excess core losses could be attributed to a deterioration of ferrite properties in the surface layer of the plates caused by mechanical stress exerted during machining. However, in a first experimental analysis no structural evidence for a deteriorated layer close to the surface is identified by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Therefore, in a next step, a new calorimetric measurement setup based on temperature rise monitoring is proposed in this paper in order to quantify and differentiate between core losses associated with the bulk and the surface of the ferrite plates and therefore to pinpoint the measured excess core loss to shallow layers of ferrite with deteriorated magnetic performance. Electrical measurement of the surface related core losses utilizing the widely accepted two-winding wattmeter method with reactive power compensation is outlined in the appendix but was not employed in this work due to comparably low measurement accuracy. By means of the proposed measurement technique, the bulk and surface core loss density of the MnZn ferrite material 3F4 from FerroxCube was determined for sinusoidal flux density amplitude varying from 75 mT up to 200 mT and excitation frequencies ranging from 200 kHz to 1 MHz. The measured core loss densities (W/cm3) show good agreement with the Steinmetz model provided by the manufacturer validating the proposed calorimetric core loss measurement technique. The measured surface loss density (W/cm2) can also be well predicted with a Steinmetz model, whereby the frequency exponent α in the surface is slightly smaller and the flux density exponent β is slightly larger compared to the Steinmetz parameter of the bulk ferrite. It is shown that the ratio between surface and bulk core losses of a composite core assembled from individual plates is only a function of plate thickness and does not depend on the actual cross section area. Critical plate thickness is then defined to be reached when the total power loss in the composite core has doubled compared to a solid (single-piece) core sample. This new quantity provides a very helpful figure for multi-gap inductor designs. Besides the deteriorated surface layers, several other mechanisms potentially contributing to increased core losses in multi-gap inductors were identified and are finally discussed in the appendix of this paper: flux crowding in the core due to tolerances and imperfections in machining and assembly; deterioration of ferrite properties due to pressure buildup in the stack of plates during the curing of the employed epoxy resin; ohmic loss in the ferrite associated with the current flowing in the conduction path provided by the low impedance of the ferrite material at high frequencies and the parasitic capacitance between winding and the ferrite core.},

This increases the coupling factor between the coils and reduces the magnetic stray field. Considering sizes, as required for charging an electric vehicle (EV), the flux guidance consists of numerous ferrite tiles. The gaps between these tiles influence the inductance of the coil and the coupling factor. On the other hand, not ideal flat edges bear the risk of individual contact points of the tiles. Due to the high magnetic conductivity of ferrite compared to an air gap, a large part of the magnetic flux flows through these points in this case. This creates the danger of local field peaks up to saturation. In this paper, the effects of gaps between ferrite tiles on the coupling factor and field distribution are investigated with a FEM -simulation model in ANSYS Maxwell.},

In this article, a thermal-magnetic multi-objective optimization function (MOF) is proposed to evaluate and mitigate the thermal-magnetic deterioration caused by the distributing airgap. The effects of the airgap on temperature and leakage distribution are analyzed based on the magnetic-thermal coupling finite element method (FEM) simulation. It is found that the trend of the local temperature is opposite to that of the magnetic leakage following the increase of the airgap width. An interesting range can also be found by using the proposed MOF strategy. When the airgap width is within the range, the gap thermal-magnetic problems can be mitigated effectively. Subsequently, a full-scale prototype with 11.1 kW at 85 kHz is fabricated to validate the effectiveness of the MOF strategy and the accuracy of evaluation. The pads with optimized airgap achieve greater comprehensive performance than that without the optimization.},

To address these concerns, past works have demonstrated the benefit of encapsulating coil assemblies in thermally conductive materials. However, due to the sensitivity of the MnZn ferrites commonly used in coil assemblies to mechanical stress, care must be taken to avoid creating large stresses in the ferrite that cause higher hysteresis loss. The stress formation in the encapsulant curing process is overviewed and modeled and an experiment is performed to demonstrate the effect in a small-scale coil assembly. Finally, the effect is shown in the reduced coil-coil efficiency of a first generation high power inductive power transfer prototype using a stiff epoxy compared to better performance in a second prototype using a softer thermally-conductive silicone encapsulant.},

Beside the electric traction drives, new technologies such as inductive charging are becoming more and more important in electric vehicles. Especially for wireless power transfer, high-frequency litz wires are used to generate the required electromagnetic field. While semi-finished products and insulation systems are continuously developing, insulation processes like potting remain unchanged. The consequence is an inappropriate insulation of the coil structure resulting in increasing eddy current losses or breakdowns of the inductance. Additionally, high mechanical and thermal loads, occurring in a typical operation environment for electric vehicles, result in accelerated aging of the insulation material. This increases the challenges in the design and manufacturing of insulation systems for inductive power transfer devices. The aim of this work is to identify and evaluate all relevant process parameters for potting high-frequency litz wires with varying primary insulation systems. To ensure the required mechanical and electrical properties, a high degree of impregnation of the litz wires is targeted.},

  abstract = {Road-embedded inductive power transfer (IPT) systems have the potential to accelerate the electrification of the transportation sector. For these systems to be economically viable, however, they need to have a similar durability and lifespan to those of asphalt roads. One area that has lacked investigation is thermally induced stresses in a primary IPT pad, which are caused by the increase in the temperature of the pad when it is energized and the differing thermal expansion of the materials within. This paper presents an experimental and a finite element-based methodology for investigating the thermal–mechanical behaviour of a 1/4 -scale double-D pad, which was energized while suspended in air, as well as energized when embedded in pavement. A focus was placed on the measurement and prediction of strains in the magnetic ferrite cores because of their brittleness. Ferrite strains were measured using a combination of resistive strain gauges and non-metallic fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Coupled electromagnetic–thermal–structural simulations were conducted to predict temperature and strains in the system, with temperature-dependent properties obtained through physical testing. At an ambient temperature of 50 ◦C, the temperature in the middle of the copper litz wire coil was predicted to be 100 ◦C in both the suspended and embedded case. There was an excellent correlation with the experimental results, with a difference of less than 10\% for most temperature measurements. When energized, the pad was predicted to experience an upward bow due to its temperature rise, resulting in bending strains in the ferrite cores. At an ambient temperature of 50 ◦C, the maximum tensile strain in the ferrites of the embedded pad was measured to be 62 microstrains (µε), with a root-mean square error that was 18 µε across three sensors. The experimental and validated numerical methodology can be applied to full-scale operational IPT pads to analyse and improve their thermal–mechanical performance.},
